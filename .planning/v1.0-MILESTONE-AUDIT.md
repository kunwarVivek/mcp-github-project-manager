## Integration Verification

### Tool Wiring

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Tools registered in ToolRegistry | 117 |
| Case handlers in index.ts | 120 |
| Tools with annotations | 117 (100%) |
| Tools with outputSchema | 117 (100%) |

### DI Container

All services properly wired in `src/container.ts`:
- GitHubRepositoryFactory (root)
- 6 extracted services
- ProjectManagementService facade

### AI Services

All AI services properly instantiated with dependencies:
- AIServiceFactory (singleton)
- Sprint AI services (4)
- Roadmap AI service (1)
- Issue intelligence services (4)

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Create project → add items → manage sprints | ✓ | Handlers wired |
| Generate PRD → generate tasks → estimate effort | ✓ | AI tools wired |
| Create status update → list updates | ✓ | Executors connected |
| Sub-issues: add → list → reprioritize → remove | ✓ | Full workflow |
| Templates: mark → copy → list | ✓ | Full workflow |

## Tech Debt

### Documentation Drift

| Item | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table | Low | Shows 48 unchecked but all requirements are complete |
| docs/TOOLS.md tool count | Low | States "115 tools" but 117 registered |
| Phase 6 VERIFICATION.md | Low | Shows gaps_found but gap was closed |

These are documentation inconsistencies, not functional issues. The codebase is correct.

### Intentional Exclusions

3 event tools (subscribe_to_events, get_recent_events, replay_events) are internal handlers, not registered in ToolRegistry. This is by design for the webhook system.

## Test Results

```
Test Suites: 70 passed, 4 skipped, 74 total
Tests:       1,474 passed, 0 failed, 1,474 total
```

4 suites skipped require real GitHub API credentials (E2E tests).

## Deliverables

| Deliverable | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| npm package | mcp-github-project-manager@1.0.2 |
| MCP tools | 117 (all annotated) |
| Test coverage | 1,474 tests |
| Documentation | README, TOOLS.md, API.md, CONFIGURATION.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md |
| CHANGELOG | v1.0.2 release notes |

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.0 is COMPLETE.**

All requirements satisfied. All phases verified. Cross-phase integration confirmed. Package published.

Minor documentation drift exists (REQUIREMENTS.md traceability, tool counts) but does not affect functionality.
