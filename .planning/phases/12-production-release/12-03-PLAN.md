<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify npm package contents and configuration</name>
  <files>package.json</files>
  <action>
Verify npm package is properly configured:

1. Run `npm pack --dry-run` to preview package contents
2. Verify no sensitive files are included:
   - No .env files
   - No credentials or API keys
   - No test files (unless intentional)
   - No .planning directory
3. Verify expected files ARE included:
   - build/**/* (compiled TypeScript)
   - LICENSE
   - README.md
4. Check package size is reasonable (< 5MB)
5. Verify package.json has:
   - Correct version (1.0.1)
   - publishConfig.access = "public"
   - bin entry pointing to build/index.js
   - files array specifying included files
   - repository, homepage, bugs URLs

Run final checks:
```bash
npm pack --dry-run
npm info mcp-github-project-manager versions  # Check if 1.0.1 exists
npm whoami  # Verify logged in as correct user
```

If 1.0.1 already published, bump to 1.0.2:
```bash
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version
```
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `npm pack --dry-run` shows only expected files
2. No .env or credential files in package
3. Package size < 5MB
4. Version is unique (not already published)
  </verify>
  <done>npm package verified and ready for publication</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Publish package to npm registry</action>
  <instructions>
The package is ready for publication. The user must run npm publish.

Before publishing:
1. Ensure you're logged in: `npm whoami`
2. Ensure build is fresh: `npm run build`
3. Final test: `npm test`

To publish:
```bash
npm publish
```

Or use the existing publish script which handles version bumping:
```bash
npm run release
```

After publishing, verify:
```bash
npm info mcp-github-project-manager
npx mcp-github-project-manager --help  # Should work
```

Test fresh install:
```bash
npm install -g mcp-github-project-manager
mcp-github-project-manager
```
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Type "published" when npm publish completes successfully, or describe any issues encountered</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>
